Some time ago I've [set to make a rowing simulator](/blog/2013/11/24/rower-a-rowing-simulator/) and few days ago, the first prototype was finished. 

![Rower ver. 0.0.1](/images/rower/rower01.jpg)

I fixed the Teva sandals with 4 velcro straps to the wooden plate:

The seat was made of wood and cushioned with foam covered with artificial leadther

The most dificult was the part for connecting the padle-handle to the wheel
