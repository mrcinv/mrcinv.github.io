  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why am I writing this post? Well today I&rsquo;ve baked an almost edible loaf of bread. And I like to note some of the thing I did right.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bread01.jpg" alt="&quot;almost edible loaf of bread&quot;" /></p>

<p>The base recepy I&rsquo;m following is from a cook book <em>Vendelina</em> and after Tinka&rsquo;s advice I&rsquo;m taking half a kilo of flour. I also kned the dough for 10 miniutes to get nice bubbles. So here is what I did</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>500g</strong> of wholewheat flour mixed with white <strong>flour</strong></li>
<li><strong>0.4l</strong> of warm <strong>water</strong></li>
<li><strong>20g</strong> of <strong>yeast</strong> (half of a 40g packet)</li>
<li><strong>4g</strong> of <strong>salt</strong> (one teaspoon)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong> Kneding time: 10 minutes</strong></p>

<h3>Baking</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>12 min</strong> at <strong>230C</strong> (fan heating)</li>
<li><strong>40 min</strong> at <strong>180C</strong> (bottom-up heating)</li>
<li>bottom tray level</li>
</ul>


<h2>The dough</h2>

<p>Decompose yeast into small pieaces and mix it with some of warm water. Add a bit of flour to feed the yeast cells. In the mean time prepare the flour in a large bowl.</p>

<p>Mix the yeast water with the flour, leave it for 1 minute and add salt and the rest of the warm water. Take care that the salt is not in direct contact with yeast for as long as possible.</p>

<h2>Kneding</h2>

<p>I kned the dough in the bowl so that Mojca does not complain too much about the flour all over the kitchen. The goal of kneding is to make long gluten molecules, so one should press and push the dough, but not tear it.</p>

<h2>Prooving</h2>

<p>First prove the dough in the bowl for an cca hour. Then kned firmly and mix whateved additives to the bread and make a loaf.</p>

<p>Dont forget to make a cross with a knife before putting the loaf to second proving. And one should be <em>patient</em> and wait long enough, so the lines in the cross are wide.</p>

<h2>Baking</h2>

<p>Put a tray at the bottom. Preheat the oven to <strong>250C</strong>. Before baking spill 1dl of water in the tray. Then put the loaf in.
After <strong>12min</strong> I reduce the temperature to <strong>180C</strong> and bake for another <strong>40min</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Baking depends greatly upon the properties of the oven used.</em></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>I should try to reduce the amount of water to 0.35l or 0.3l (as in the original recepy)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having small kids and  <em>piip pip</em> (censured by my better half), my physical activity was reduced to minimum in the last year. When my brother bought a rowing simulator <a href="http://www.waterrower.com/">Water rower</a> I instantly wanted to have my own. These machines come at a price however. So I decided to build one of by my self. Its mostly wood, so how hard can it be.</p>

<h2>The idea</h2>

<p>So, the design of the Water rower is really simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>two planks serve as a rails for the troley</li>
<li>the troley is a simple wooden box</li>
<li>the paddle handle is fixed by a 2cm belt</li>
<li>the belt winds from a reel, which rotates a paddle inside a bucket of water</li>
<li>at the bottom, there is an bungee elastic, which rolls back the belt at the end of the stoke</li>
</ul>


<p>The clever part of this design is the <em>paddle rotating in water</em>, which creates a resistance close to that on the real rowboat. This part of the design is also a major obtacle for DIY design. To create watertight container with rotating paddles inside would be too much for my level of skills.</p>

<h2>The nature of the Force</h2>

<p>After finally discarding the idea of building the water container, I started to think with what I can replace it. People made similar devices with bungee elastics. But the elastic produce the force proportional to the change of its length. So at the end of the stroke, the force would be the biggest. The force I would be pulling would be
 $$F_e=k\cdot x$$
where x is the length I would extent the elastic when I would pull the handle.</p>

<p>Appart from that, the elastic save most of the energy needed for the extension and that energy is returned at the second part of the stroke. When rowing however, no energy is returned to the rower. All the enery gets dissipated by the resistance of the water.</p>

<p>Resistance is quite a different kind of a force. It is proportional to the velocity:
  $$F_r = &ndash;\alpha \cdot \dot{x}.$$
Ok, if you row very fast, the quadratic law of resistance would apply. Water rower solved this with a brilliant idea to use water for the resistence, while other manufactors use fans, which move air through smal holes, to create similar kind of force.</p>

<h2>Finding the Force</h2>

<p>So I start walking like professor Baltazar in the cartoon, to figure out what could be used to produce the kind of resistence I needed. And then as in the cartoon it came into my mind, that bycicle trainers offer the same kind of resistence. I have one at home, that uses oil chamber to use viscous force of oil, to create resistance. Sounds familiar to paddles in a woter tank :&ndash;) The trainer is <a href="http://www.elite-it.com/products/">Elite Super Crono</a>. Even if you buy a new one, it would cost around 250€, so there is quite a margin to the original <a href="http://www.waterrower.com">Water rower</a>. This is the first sketch</p>
